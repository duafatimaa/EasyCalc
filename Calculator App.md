# Calculator App
The calculator app is a program that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is built using the Python programming language and a GUI (Graphical User Interface) framework called tkinter. The app's code is divided into two main branches: "functions" and "gui."

The "functions" branch contains the core logic of the app, including a calculator function that performs the calculations. It uses an atomic model folder structure, which organizes the code into small, independent modules.

The "gui" branch contains the user interface for the app. It is built using the tkinter framework, which allows for the creation of buttons, text boxes, and other visual elements. The GUI has two pages: the first page where users enter their numbers and select the operation they want to perform, and the second page where the result of the calculation is displayed.

Finally, the "master" branch combines both the "functions" and "gui" branches to create the complete calculator app. Users can enter two numbers and select the desired operation from the provided buttons, and the calculator will display the result of the calculation. Overall, the calculator app is a simple but powerful tool that provides an efficient means of performing basic arithmetic operations.

To start using the calculator app, users must first launch it on their device. This can be done by running the Python code from their terminal or through an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm or Visual Studio Code. Once the app is launched, users will see the GUI's first page, which contains two entry fields for entering numbers and a set of buttons for selecting the operation they want to perform.

The operations that users can perform include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator function in the "functions" branch uses conditional statements to determine which operation to perform based on the user's selection.

After the user enters their numbers and selects the desired operation, they can click the "calculate" button, which triggers the calculator function to perform the calculation. The result is then displayed on the second page of the GUI, where users can see the result of their calculation.

One advantage of using the atomic model folder structure in the "functions" branch is that it allows for modular programming, making it easier to test and debug the code. Additionally, the use of the tkinter framework in the "gui" branch provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface that simplifies the process of performing arithmetic calculations.

In summary, the calculator app is a simple yet effective program that makes performing basic arithmetic calculations easy and efficient. The use of the atomic model folder structure and the tkinter GUI framework helps to simplify the code, making it easier to maintain and debug.
